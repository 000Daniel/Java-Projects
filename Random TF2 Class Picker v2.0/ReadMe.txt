This software chooses a random class from the game 'Team Fortress 2', and chooses a random Load-out number(1-4).
If you are not sure what class to pick or what loadout to play with, you can use this software to decide!

This software is a new iteration of my original 'class picker', and now it come with a GUI!


*This was tested on Windows 10 Pro edition.
